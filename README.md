## Overview

`YT-Shorts-Maker` is a Python toolset designed to simplify the process of creating engaging Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. With just one click, you can transform long videos into viral clips, making it an ideal tool for content creators looking to boost their social media presence effortlessly. This open-source tool is an alternative to popular platforms like [Klap.app](https://klap.app/), [2short.ai](https://2short.ai/), Spikes Studio, and [Vizard.ai](https://vizard.ai/). Reels can be generated for as low as 10 cents per reel using the OpenAI API.

Here's an updated installation guide that you can include in your README:

---

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the `YT-Shorts-Maker` tool on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Git Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MArsalanJaved/ReelDaddy.git
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a New Virtual Environment

Navigate to the cloned repository's folder:

```bash
cd ReelDaddy
```

Create and activate a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv reels-env
source reels-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `reels-env\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install the Required Dependencies

Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for processing video files. Below are instructions for installing FFmpeg on different platforms:

#### macOS

You can install FFmpeg using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Windows

Download FFmpeg from the official [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Make sure to add FFmpeg to your system's PATH variable.

#### Linux

On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

For other Linux distributions, use your package manager to install FFmpeg.

### Step 5: Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and include your OpenAI API Key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY='Your-OpenAI-API-key-here'
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Download a YouTube Video

Use the `downloadYT.py` script to download a video from YouTube.

```bash
python downloadYT.py <youtube-id>
```

- **youtube-id**: This is the unique identifier found in the YouTube video URL. For example, in the URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the `youtube-id` would be `dQw4w9WgXcQ`.

### Step 2: Generate Engaging Reels

Once you have downloaded the video, use the `shortMaker.py` script to generate a reel.

```bash
python shortMaker.py <youtube-id>
```

This script will automatically:

- Cut the video into shorter clips.
- Focus on the person speaking in the video.
- Create engaging reels optimized for Instagram and YouTube.

## Sample Output

Below are examples of how the tool transforms a raw video into engaging content.
