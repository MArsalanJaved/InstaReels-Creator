## Overview

`YT-Shorts-Maker` is a Python toolset designed to simplify the process of creating engaging Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. This tool allows you to download YouTube videos and automatically generate short-form video content that focuses on key moments, such as when someone is speaking. It's perfect for content creators who want to increase their social media engagement effortlessly.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Download a YouTube Video

Use the `downloadYT.py` script to download a video from YouTube.

```bash
python downloadYT.py <youtube-id>
```

- **youtube-id**: This is the unique identifier found in the YouTube video URL. For example, in the URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the `youtube-id` would be `dQw4w9WgXcQ`.

### Step 2: Generate Engaging Reels

Once you have downloaded the video, use the `shortMaker.py` script to generate a reel.

```bash
python shortMaker.py <youtube-id>
```

This script will automatically:

- Cut the video into shorter clips.
- Focus on the person speaking in the video.
- Create engaging reels optimized for Instagram and YouTube.

## Sample Output

Below are examples of how the tool transforms a raw video into engaging content.
